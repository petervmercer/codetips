# EC2 Introduction

EC2 is like a virtual machine and it's hosted by AWS instead of being in your
own data center and the great thing about it is that you can:
 - select the capacity that you need right now. 
 - grow and shrink whenever you need,
 - pay only for what you use 
 - ready to install your application in minutes rather than waiting months.
